# John Le

Interests
* Sometimes I like doing origami (art of folding paper) in my free time.
* I've been taking a little dip into game development but I haven't learned too much so far.
* I like traveling and I'm going to Vietnam this summer.

## Technical Background
I have experience mostly in Python, Bash, and C. I've used the Flask framework in Python before and I'm taking a Web Application Programming course that I'm learning HTML and CSS in.
